          CRISPR-Cas9 has revolutionized the field of genetic engineering since its discovery. This powerful tool allows
          scientists to make precise edits to DNA, opening up new possibilities in medicine, agriculture, and
          biotechnology. Recent advancements have further expanded its capabilities and applications.
        </p>
        <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-4">Enhanced Precision and Efficiency</h2>
        <p>
          Researchers have developed new variants of the Cas9 enzyme that offer improved specificity and reduced
          off-target effects. These enhancements make CRISPR-Cas9 an even more reliable tool for gene editing,
          especially in therapeutic applications where precision is crucial.
        </p>
        <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-4">Expanded Target Range</h2>
        <p>
          New CRISPR systems, such as Cas12 and Cas13, have been discovered and engineered to target a wider range of
          genetic sequences. This expansion allows scientists to edit previously inaccessible parts of the genome,
          broadening the scope of potential applications.
        </p>
        <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-4">In Vivo Applications</h2>
        <p>
          Significant progress has been made in delivering CRISPR-Cas9 components directly into living organisms. This
          advancement brings us closer to treating genetic disorders in humans through in vivo gene editing, a prospect
          that was once thought to be far in the future.
        </p>
        <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-4">Conclusion</h2>
        <p>
          As CRISPR-Cas9 technology continues to evolve, its potential applications in medicine, agriculture, and
          biotechnology grow exponentially. These advancements bring us closer to a future where genetic diseases can be
          cured, crops can be made more resilient, and biological systems can be engineered with unprecedented
          precision.
