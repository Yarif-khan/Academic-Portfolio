        <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-4">AlphaFold: A Breakthrough in Protein Structure Prediction</h2>
        <p>
          DeepMind's AlphaFold has emerged as a game-changer in protein structure prediction. By leveraging deep
          learning techniques, AlphaFold can predict protein structures with remarkable accuracy, often matching or
          exceeding experimental methods in terms of precision.
        </p>
        <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-4">Impact on Drug Discovery</h2>
        <p>
          The ability to accurately predict protein structures has significant implications for drug discovery. Machine
          learning models can now be used to screen potential drug candidates more efficiently, predict protein-ligand
          interactions, and design novel therapeutic molecules with greater precision.
        </p>
        <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-4">Challenges and Future Directions</h2>
        <p>
          While machine learning has dramatically improved protein structure prediction, challenges remain. These
          include predicting the structures of protein complexes, understanding protein dynamics, and integrating
          structural predictions with other types of biological data. Ongoing research is focused on addressing these
          challenges and further refining prediction accuracy.
        </p>
        <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-4">Conclusion</h2>
        <p>
          The integration of machine learning in protein structure prediction represents a significant leap forward in
          structural biology. As these technologies continue to evolve, they promise to accelerate our understanding of
          protein function, facilitate drug discovery, and open new avenues in personalized medicine and biotechnology.
